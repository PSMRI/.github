# Welcome to PSMRI on GitHub ðŸŒŸ

At **Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute (PSMRI)**, we are committed to leveraging technology and systems thinking to improve public health outcomes and transform lives across India. Our initiatives address systemic challenges in healthcare delivery by fostering digital adoption, decentralization, and evidence-based governance.

## Who We Are
PSMRI is part of the **Piramal Foundation**, a purpose-driven organization that has touched over 100 million lives in 27 states over the past 17 years. Focused on creating sustainable impact, we address critical issues in **healthcare**, **education**, **sustainability**, and **gender inclusion**. 

Our mission is to build **à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤** through leadership, digitization, and inclusion, led by women and youth.

## Our Focus Areas
- **Digital Public Health**: Empower healthcare providers with cutting-edge tools to ensure seamless and efficient service delivery.
- **Government Institution Strengthening**: Support state governments in using data-driven governance for decentralized decision-making.
- **Citizen and Community Engagement**: Enhance citizens' access to healthcare and improve engagement with public systems.
- **Distributed Governance**: Build scalable and resilient systems to address state capacity gaps.

## Our Approach: PTOD Framework
The **PTOD (Process reengineering, Technology, Organizational Change Management, Data)** approach is a cornerstone of PSMRIâ€™s strategy to enable large-scale digital transformation. Each component plays a critical role in fostering systemic change:

### 1. **Process Reengineering**
- Diagnose and simplify traditional government workflows to eliminate inefficiencies.
- Use **Lean Six Sigma** and **Design Thinking** methodologies to analyze as-is processes and create to-be solutions.
- Conduct design-thinking workshops with key stakeholders to co-create user-centred workflows.

### 2. **Technology Enablement**
- Build and scale cost-effective, open-source, and sustainable digital solutions.
- Leverage **Digital Public Goods (DPGs)** to avoid vendor lock-ins and ensure scalability.
- Integrate data platforms and dashboards for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

### 3. **Organizational Change Management**
- Redefine roles and responsibilities to sustain digital adoption.
- Conduct capacity-building programs to upskill staff and align stakeholders.
- Provide on-ground handholding and support systems to drive behavioural change.

### 4. **Data-Driven Governance**
- Establish systems for effective data collection, visualization, and management.
- Develop dashboards and tools that empower decision-makers with actionable insights.
- Ensure data security, privacy, and compliance with governance policies.

By combining these four pillars, PSMRI addresses the systemic gaps in public health systems, driving sustainable impact at scale.

## Impact Highlights
- Implemented digital health solutions across **16 states** and **46 lower health facilities**.
- Digitized public health systems in **5 lighthouse states**: UP, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, and Chhattisgarh.
- **3.8 crore ABHA IDs** generated under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission.
- Increased electronic health record adoption from **10% to 80%** in Bihar, improving service quality and efficiency.

## Technology for Transformation
PSMRI is dedicated to building **Digital Public Goods (DPGs)** for scalable and sustainable solutions. Our flagship platform, **AMRIT**, integrates with state health systems to provide:
- Telemedicine services.
- Real-time dashboards for healthcare monitoring.
- Support for mobile medical units and frontline workers.
